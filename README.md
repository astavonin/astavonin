🤟 Hey there! I’m a Software Engineer who’s spent decades diving deep into software architecture, distributed computing, and security. I love tackling complex problems, designing scalable systems, and ensuring things don’t just work—but work really well.

👉 I'm currently working on [The Go Optimization Guide](https://goperf.dev), helping developers build efficient and performant Go applications.

➡️ You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/astavonin) or check my latest [blog posts](http://sysdev.me).

🏔️ When I’m not at my keyboard, I love traveling, capturing beautiful [nature shots](https://www.instagram.com/kaapython/) and [portraits](https://www.instagram.com/alexandveronika/), or spending time with my German Shepherd, [Molly](https://sysdev.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1.jpeg)—she brings so much joy to my life!
